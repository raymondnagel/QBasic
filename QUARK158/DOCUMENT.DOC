                                 ~~~~~~~~~
                             * DOCUMENTATION *

QUARK-79 is greatly affiliated with it's sequel, QUARK-158. Every effort has
been made to make QUARK-158 a better game than QUARK-79, and at the same time,
to preserve the orginal theme and story of QUARK-79.

                                  -STORY-

In the first episode, the heroic Mike Maelstrom had set out in the QUARK-79
spaceship to destroy the Soviet Space Flotilla and its gigantic "Mother Ship". 
Upon completing this task, the Galactic Federation of Planets (GFP) unanimously 
decided to elect him as its own new president. To justify this great office, 
Maelstrom at once set to righting the wrongs caused by the Soviet Space 
Flotilla...

Two years later, the blueprints for the QUARK-79 spaceship were stolen by a 
traitor and handed over to Igor Nemisvitz, the Socialist Dictator of Mars.
Soon, hundreds of QUARK-79 clones began showing up, trashing the universe
and making havoc of the GFP's attempts at peace. Finally, Maelstrom went to
work on a new project: the QUARK-158 spaceship. Its purpose: to take on the
army of QUARK-79 clones, to annihilate the infamous traitor guilty of stealing
the QUARK-79 blueprints, and to destroy the QUARK-79 clone factory on Mars, 
which creates dozens of these powerful machines daily.

                               -THE MISSION-

Your mission will take you across the galaxy and onto many planets. Due to the
GFP's peaceful endeavors over the past two years, however, the planets remain
fairly peaceful. But there are many dangers:

* QUARK-79 clones
With powerful laser cannons and the ability to warp around the solar system, 
you're likely to find these ships anywhere. (A comparison of the QUARK-79 and
QUARK-158 are offered at the end of this document)
* The Asteroid Belt
Be cautious when you enter the asteroid belt. Drifting through this thick wave
of debris are many dense asteroids. It is not too difficult to avoid them,
but stay on your toes: on direct hit can ruin your whole day.
* The Black Hole
This strange vacuum floats around the galaxy sucking in any loose material.
I advise you to stay away from it, because it is not easy to escape once you
get sucked in.

                                 -CONTROLS-

                             -TROUBLESHOOTING-

PROBLEM:
The game will not work at all.
SOLUTION(S):
1.) You must be in the QUARK-158 directory before running QUARK-158.
2.) The program requires Microsoft QBasic; it will not function without it.

PROBLEM:
The characters will not accept my dialogue.
SOLUTION(S):
1.) Use only one case. 
2.) Use simple dialogues (1 or 2 words) 
3.) Do not use any commas

PROBLEM:
My laser cannon will not fire.
SOLUTION(S):
1.) Make sure NUM LOCK is on.
2.) The cannon will not fire if your ship is out of power.

                                  -CLUES-                               

If you forgot where your next destination should be, or if you need a clue, 
visit King Don Juan Carlos IV on Jupiter, your home planet.                               
                               
* POWER UNITS
The QUARK-158 spaceship is run on power units.
@ Every time you move your spaceship, you use 1 power unit.
@ Every time you shoot your laser cannon, you use 10 power units.
@ Every time you get shot by an enemy ship, your shield uses 100 power units.
@ The black hole and the asteroids drain your power on contact, killing you.
@ You can refill your power units at any planet. (MAXIMUM POWER: 500)
